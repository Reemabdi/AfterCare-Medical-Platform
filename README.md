# AfterCare Medical Platform

##  Overview
The **After Care Medical Platform** is a web-based solution designed to provide patients with clear, accessible, and organized aftercare instructions following medical procedures.  
The platform aims to improve the patient experience, reduce misunderstandings, and support recovery by making essential medical guidance available anytime and anywhere.

This system was developed as part of my **training project at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC)**.
